🌟 Enhancing emotion classification on the ISEAR dataset using fine-tuning and data augmentation with hybrid transformer models
This repository contains the complete implementation of our research on fine-grained emotion classification using hybrid transformer models and data augmentation 
techniques.

📖 Overview
Emotion detection is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with applications in:
*  Customer support
*  Mental health analysis
*  Social media sentiment analysis

🗂️ Repository Highlights
🚀 Models Included
This repository features 10 unique Jupyter notebooks, each representing one of the following models:
1️⃣ DeBERTa-v3-large + CNN (Hybrid) 
2️⃣ DeBERTa-v3-large
3️⃣ Electra + CNN (Hybrid)
4️⃣ Electra-base-discriminator
5️⃣ RoBerta + CNN (Hybrid)
6️⃣ RoBerta-base
7️⃣ T5-base + CNN (Hybrid)
8️⃣ T5-base
9️⃣ XLNet-based-cased + CNN (Hybrid)
🔟 XLNet-based-cased

🎯 Key Results
Dataset: ISEAR dataset, annotated with 7 emotions: anger, joy, sadness, fear, disgust, guilt, and shame.
🏆 Top Performer: The DeBERTa-v3-large + CNN hybrid model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 94.94%, excelling in classifying subtle emotions like shame and disgust.
⭐ Strong Models: Electra-base-discriminator and XLNet-based-cased, with accuracies of 93%.


✨ Conclusion
This work highlights the effectiveness of hybrid Transformer-CNN models in improving emotion classification accuracy, particularly for imbalanced datasets and nuanced emotion distinctions.
